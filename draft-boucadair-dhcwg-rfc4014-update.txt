    RADIUS Attributes Permitted in RADIUS Attributes DHCP Suboption
                draft-boucadair-dhcwg-rfc4014-update-00

Abstract

   The RADIUS Attributes suboption enables a network element to pass
   identification and authorization attributes received during RADIUS
   authentication to a DHCP server.  However, RFC 4014 defines a frozen
   list of RADIUS attributes that can be included in such a suboption.
   This document updates RFC 4014 by relaxing that constraint and
   allowing to tag additional RADIUS Attributes as permitted in the
   RADIUS Attributes DHCP suboption.

1.  Introduction

   The RADIUS Attributes suboption ([RFC4014]) enables a network element
   to pass identification and authorization attributes received during
   RADIUS authentication [RFC2865] to a DHCP server [RFC2131].  However,
   [RFC4014] defines a frozen set of RADIUS attributes that can be
   included in such a suboption.  Such limitation is suboptimal in
   context where new services are deployed (e.g., support of encrypted
   DNS [I-D.ietf-add-dnr]).

   Section 3 updates RFC 4014 by relaxing that constraint and allowing
   to tag additional RADIUS Attributes as permitted in the RADIUS
   Attributes DHCP suboption.  To that aim, a new IANA registry is
   created to maintain the set of permitted attributes in the RADIUS
   Attributes DHCP suboption.  The maintenance of such a registry is
   similar to the one in [RFC7037].

   [I-D.ietf-opsawg-add-encrypted-dns] defines the DHCPv4-Options RADIUS
   attribute that can be used by a DHCP relay agent, collocated with a
   RADIUS client, to pass attributes obtained from a RADIUS server to a
   DHCP server.  The DHCPv4-Options RADIUS attribute can, for example,
   include a list of encrypted DNS resolvers.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Updates to RFC4014


3.1.  Section 3 of RFC4014

   This document updates Section 3 of [RFC4014] as follows:

   OLD:
      To avoid dependencies between the address allocation and other
      state information between the RADIUS server and the DHCP server,
      the DHCP relay agent SHOULD include only the attributes in the
      table below in an instance of the RADIUS Attributes suboption.
      The table, based on the analysis in RFC 3580 [8], lists attributes
      that MAY be included:

                 #   Attribute
               ---   ---------
                 1   User-Name (RFC 2865 [3])
                 6   Service-Type (RFC 2865)
                26   Vendor-Specific (RFC 2865)
                27   Session-Timeout (RFC 2865)
                88   Framed-Pool (RFC 2869)
               100   Framed-IPv6-Pool (RFC 3162 [7])

   NEW:
      To avoid dependencies between the address allocation and other
      state information between the RADIUS server and the DHCP server,
      the DHCP relay agent SHOULD include only the attributes in the
      IANA-maintained registry (Section 4) in an instance of the RADIUS
      Attributes suboption.

3.2.  Section 4 of RFC4014

   This document updates Section 4 of [RFC4014] as follows:

   OLD:
      If the relay agent relays RADIUS attributes not included in the
      table in Section 4, the DHCP server SHOULD ignore them.

Internet-Draft      RADIUS Attributes DHCP Suboption        October 2022


   NEW:
      If the relay agent relays RADIUS attributes not included in the
      IANA-maintained registry (Section 4), the DHCP server SHOULD
      ignore them.

4.  IANA Considerations

   IANA is requested to create a new sub-registry entitled "RADIUS
   Attributes Permitted in RADIUS Attributes Sub-option" in the "Dynamic
   Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP)
   Parameters" registry [BOOTP].

   The allocation policy of this new sub-registry is Expert Review per
   [RFC8126].  Designated experts should carefully consider the security
   implications of allowing the relay agent to include new RADIUS
   attributes to this registry.

   The initial content of this sub-registry is listed in Table 1.

             | 100       | Framed-IPv6-Pool | RFC 3162      |
             +-----------+------------------+---------------+
             | 245.TBA1  | DHCPv4-Options   | This-Document |
             +-----------+------------------+---------------+

5.  Security Considerations

   This document does not add new security considerations to those
   already discussed in Section 7 of [RFC4014].
