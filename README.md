RADIUS Attributes Permitted in RADIUS Attributes DHCP Suboption
               draft-boucadair-dhcwg-rfc4014-update-00

Abstract

   The RADIUS Attributes suboption enables a network element to pass
   identification and authorization attributes received during RADIUS
   authentication to a DHCP server.  However, RFC 4014 defines a frozen
   list of RADIUS attributes that can be included in such a suboption.
   This document updates RFC 4014 by relaxing that constraint and
   allowing to tag additional RADIUS Attributes as permitted in the
   RADIUS Attributes DHCP suboption.
